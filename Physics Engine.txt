""" Step 1
Stop at the right wall

Tomás works on the physics engine for a game studio. A physics engine simulates events like movement, acceleration, and collision, so game objects can interact with each other.

Tomás's simulation moves a ball to the right for several time steps, but then the ball disappears. What edge case did he miss? The ball is passing through the right wall!

    Add a third parameter to the move() function that represents the position of the right wall.
    Modify the move() function body to stop the ball at the right wall.

The screen starts at position 0, continues for output_width units, and then ends at the right wall. That means the right wall position is equal to output_width.

If the ball tries to move past the right wall, move() should just return the right wall position.
